## About ailia SDK

ailia SDK is a cross-platform high speed inference SDK. The ailia SDK provides a consistent C++ API on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android and Jetson. It supports Unity, Python and JNI for efficient AI implementation. The ailia SDK makes great use of the GPU via Vulkan and Metal to serve accelerated computing.
